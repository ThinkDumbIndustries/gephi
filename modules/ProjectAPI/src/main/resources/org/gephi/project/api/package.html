            API for project and workspace management.
        </p>
        <p>
            From <code>ProjectController</code>, projects and workspaces can
            be managed. A project is a collection of workspaces, of which one and only one can be active at a time. By
            default, a new project has one workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only one project can be open at the time. The <code>ProjectController</code> can manage a list of projects
            but it's assumed that a project has an existing project file so that it can be opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workspaces, where modules are interacting can be accessed from
            the current project and by listening through <code>WorkspaceListener</code>.
            Workspaces are suitable for hosting any type of data modules wants to.
