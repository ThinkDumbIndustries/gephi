  **Gephi is the leading open-source platform for visualizing and manipulating large graphs.**
  * **Fast** Powered by a built-in OpenGL engine, Gephi is able to push the envelope with very large networks. Visualize networks up to a million elements. All actions (e.g. layout, filter, drag) run in real-time.
  * **Simple** Easy to install and get started. An UI that is centered around the visualization. Like Photoshopâ„¢ for graphs.
  * **Extensible** Extend Gephi with plug-ins.
